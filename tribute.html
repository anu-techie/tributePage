            <p> Amma, who is known as <b>Latha</b>, She was born in 1974 in Tiruppur. She studied up until 1984 but had to drop it because their mother died, which marked her struggling life. She was enslaved in the house of her relatives. Then she climbed the first step with her own efforts. She returned to Tiruppur after giving up her belongings and started her career there in one of the garments. Later, at the age of 23, she held the hands of Mr. Balasubramaniam and settled in Erode. Then the next chapter of her struggling life began. In that chapter, she was more than her husband to raise the family and succeeded in that. Mainly, she did not compromise on her children's education, even though she had no food. <b> Her sacrifice and hard work helped her achieve her goals</b>. Under no circumstances did she give up her self-respect, not even to her husband. Even at the age of 50, she proves that age is no barrier to success in her endeavors as a tailor. She inspires a lot of women around her, including me. May her achievements continue, Although I am not old enough to bless her, I salute her. <b>Proud of My AMMA</b></p>
